  author={Liu, Shixian and Barinov, A.A. and Yin, Fei and Khvesyuk, V.I.},
  abstract={We estimate the thermal properties of unsmooth Si nanowires, considering key factors such as size (diameter), surface texture (roughness) and quantum size effects (phonon states) at different temperatures. For nanowires with a diameter of less than 20 nm, we highlight the importance of quantum size effects in heat capacity calculations, using dispersion relations derived from the modified frequency equation for the elasticity of a rod. The thermal conductivities of nanowires with diameters of 37, 56, and 115nm are predicted using the Fuchs– Sondheimer model and Soffer’s specular parameter. Notably, the roughness parameters are chosen to reflect the technological characteristics of the real surfaces. Our findings reveal that surface texture plays a significant role in thermal conductivity, particularly in the realm of ballistic heat transfer within nanowires. This study provides practical recommendations for developing new thermal management materials.},

  title={Validation of the STEG code using experiments on two-phase flow across horizontal tube bundles},
  author={Liu, Shixian and Yin, Fei and Melikhov, V.I. and Melikhov, O.I.},
  abstract={The results of the validation of the STEG code using the experiments on two-phase flow across horizontal tube bundles are presented. The experiments are carried out on two water–air SG models, consisting of a transparent vessels, inside of which there is a tube bundle, a perforated sheet and a bead separating the upstream section of the circulation circuit of the model from the downstream one. The void fractions and water velocities are measured in different locations of the models. The brief description of the STEG code based on the 3D two-fluid model is presented. A set of interfacial drag correlations, which was recently developed by the authors, are used in the validation calculations. The peculiarities of the spatial two-phase flows have been established, and a quantitative comparison with experimental data has been performed. Good agreement between the calculated and experimental data is obtained.},
