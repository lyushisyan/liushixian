Welcome! 

I'm a PhD student at the Department of Thermophysics at Bauman Moscow State Technical University. My advisors are Khvesyuk V.I. and Barinov A.A. My research focuses on understanding heat transfer phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. Specifically, I'm intrigued by the intricate dynamics of phonons and how they govern thermal transport processes. 

Before that, I graduated from Moscow Power Engineering Institute and North China Electric Power University. I worked with my advisor Melikhov V.I. on mathematical modeling of water vapor separation in steam generators.

My current work primarily revolves around mathematical modeling to unravel the complexities of phonon physics and its implications on heat transfer. By delving into these intricate mechanisms, I aim to contribute to advancements in thermal management technologies and materials design.
